                                         <h2>JUMP</h2>

<p>
    Jumping is a technique used by many F2P players to get a head start on a new server (or just keep up with everyone else doing it!). You are allowed to move to a kingdom less than 10 days old if your town hall is at level 7 or –


     <h2>WHAT TO DO DURING THE JUMP PROCESS?</h2>
<ul>
Upgrade all buildings to level 7 

<li>Complete all surveys (visit the Surveys section for details) Complete missions Store lots of resources in items (resources outside of items that exceed your storage capacity will prevent you from “skipping”)</li>

<li>Explore the entire map, getting all the free level 1 troops and cave chests. Collect the chests from the cave (medium and high only). You can get many Golden Keys, Troops, VIP which will help to increase the skill of your commanders. This can be a huge advantage </li>

<li>For F2P, but it requires a lot of effort. P2W players generally do not need to do this, as they can increase in power so quickly that the advantages presented seem negligible, however some do it to save money at the beginning or just for fun.</li>
</ul>
</p><br />

                        <h2>AFTER THE JUMP</h2>

<p>To make sure that you continue to grow, see bellow CH requirements.
